# TV-Ad-Sales-Prediction
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for a Machine Learning project that uses Simple Linear Regression to predict sales based on TV marketing budget. The project involves understanding the data structure, importing data using the pandas library, and building a linear regression model to predict 'Sales' using 'TV' as the predictor variable.
